# Random password generator
> A very simple password generator i made for fun using python (Using [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI) framework)
 
## Installation

There is none, just download the .exe release and run it.
> Alternatively, you can find the compiled .exe file under RPG/GUI/dist/

## Requirements
> The code was tested and ran using python 3.10.2. Older versions might not work. Newer should probably be fine but report in case you run into any error :)
```shell
pip install PySimpleGUI
```

## Run
```shell
$ python .\RPG\rpgGUI.py
```

## Extra
If something breaks, please let me know by messaging on discord (preferrably) or twitter. You can find both on my github profile

## No GUI Version
> It was more convenient for me to drop the version, so it is not as updated as the version with a GUI (it's much much simpler). From version 1.1 it will be removed, but you can always find it in the 1.0 source code if you need it :)
