# Random pass_prop generator
> A very simple pass_prop generator i made for fun using python (Using [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI) framework)
 
## Installation

There is none, just download the .exe release and run it.
> Alternatively, you can find the compiled .exe file under RPG/GUI/dist/

## Requirements
> The code was tested and ran using python 3.10.2. Older versions might not work. Newer should probably be fine but report in case you run into any error :)
```shell
pip install PySimpleGUI
```

## Run
```shell
$ python .\RPG\rpgGUI.py
```

## Extra
If something breaks, please let me know by messaging on discord or open a github issue (preferrably these 2) or twitter (i don't check as much). You can find both my discord and twitter on my github profile

## No GUI Version
> It was more convenient for me to drop this for every release, so it will not be as updated as the one with a GUI (it's much much simpler for me). From release 1.1 i will only add it for major version/fixes. You can ask me for a specific no GUI release only if you really really need it (ex: project that needs this).

## Using this in other Github Projects
Please ask me! I will most likely be happy to say yes, but please just ask before you use this, it really doesn't take much to do! You can use my discord (preferrably) or twitter :)
P.S.: Please don't open any issue regarding this as i will probably close them. I'd like anything related to this to be discussed in private.
